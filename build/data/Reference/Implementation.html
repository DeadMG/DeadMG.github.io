        <p>The Wide implementation guarantees that there is no hidden mutable global state used. It is entirely safe to construct and use multiple instances of all Wide classes on different threads. Typically, it is not safe to 
        use the same instance on multiple threads at once.</p>
        <p>The Wide implementation was built to be extensible. The intention is that it should be modifiable and extendable without having to rebuild the library. My general experience of Clang-as-a-library is that many useful 
        functions are hidden away as implementation details. In contrast, Wide is typically built to make core implementation interfaces usable and as abstract as possible. As far as Wide is concerned, if you can add new functionality
        or re-use the existing functinality in a new way, then it's not an implementation detail.</p>
        <p>Wide's primary structure is composed of three libraries- lexer, parser, and analyzer. To offer interfaces to the outside world, Wide has two driver projects- CLI and CAPI- that take user input and use it to drive these 
        libraries. The libraries are built to operate independently- for example, the parser can parse any token source, and the analyzer can operate on any AST.</p>
