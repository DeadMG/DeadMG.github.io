    <p>Wide ranges are used in both the current language's default libraries, and also in a few places in the compiler implementation. The basic principle of a Wide range (of T) is that it is a function or function object that, when
    called, produces an optional&lt;T&gt. If the optional is empty, then the range is at the end. Else it contains the next value in the range. This is essentially a simplification of input iterators that's much easier to work with.
    The use of Wide ranges in the compiler implementation is designed mostly to simplify the implementation's exact needs, not as a general range replacement, although it is possible to write various range-based functions on top of
    this abstraction, so the existing adapter functions are mostly those that were needed, rather than every possible one.</p>
    <p>It is possible that they will become more of a general iterator replacement in the future.</p>

    <p>Wide ranges are principally used in the compiler as input to and output from the <a href="${get_url_to_from('data/Reference/Implementation/Lexer.html', path)}">lexer</a>, and input to the <a href="${}">parser</a>.</p>
