    <p>The Wide token interface represents a Wide token. Typically, they are created by <a href="${get_url_to_from('data/Reference/Implementation/Lexer/lexerh.html', path)}">the lexer</a>, but users can create whatever arbitrary 
    tokens they want with the constructor. The following elements are listed in the Wide::Lexer namespace:</p>
    namespace:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <colgroup><col class="col-md-1"></col><col class="col-md-7"></col></colgroup>
        <tr>Name<th></th><th>Function</th></tr>
        <tr><td>TokenType</td><td>It defines a TokenType type, which is currently a <code>const std::string*</code> that indicates the run-time type of a token. It's intentional that users can define their own token types and add 
        them to the lexer's data structures. The default token types are in a TokenTypes subnamespace, e.g. const std::string Wide::Lexer::TokenTypes::OpenBracket.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Position</td><td>Represents a location in a source file. Must be constructed with a <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;std::string&gt;</code> that represents the filename. Note that Wide does not require this to actually be a
        filename on the hard disk- it is only ever de-referenced for diagnostics, so it should never be null, but else can be anything. Position also contains a line, column, and offset, and before/after functions. Adding two 
        Positions produces a Range. The offset is primarily to represent a position in a hypothetical buffer holding the characters of the source file to make it easier to locate.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Range</td><td>Immutable. Represents a range of characters in the input. Can be constructed from a <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;std::string&gt;</code>, or a single Position, or a pair of Positions. Provides operator+ to
        create one range that includes both of the source ranges and any space between.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>to_string, operator+</td><td>Overloads of operator+ and to_string are provided here. You can concatenate a Position or Range with a string, and call to_string(pos) or to_string(range).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Token</td><td>The immutable Token class itself. Must be constructed from a range, a TokenType, and a string value. This value typically corresponds to the source that produced that token. It's only really meaningful
        for variable-length tokens like identifiers, strings, and integers.</td></tr>
