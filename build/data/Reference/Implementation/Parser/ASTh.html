    <p>All structures for the Wide AST are listed in the namespace <code>Wide::Parse</code>. The Wide AST is a fairly plain tree structure. It uses non-owning references to connect the leaves. The creator is responsible for owning 
    the elements- in the case of parsed elements, they are owned by the Parser. Every AST element holds a record of the location it came from. Like in the lexer, filenames and locations are never inspected except to print them out 
    for error locations. Each AST node has a constructor detailing what elements are required to construct it. The AST does not record some forms guaranteed to be equal- for example, the AST does not record whether the short or 
    long form was used to define a function or type. AST node pointers are guaranteed to be non-null, except where the grammar permits the user to choose between multiple forms. These are recorded below:</p>
    <table clas="table">
        <colgroup><col class="col-md-1"></col><col class="col-md-7"></col></colgroup>
        <tr><th>Node type</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
        <tr><td>While</td><td>Represents a while statement. Either <code>condition</code> or <code>var_condition</code> will be null. If var_condition is non-null, then the user used the form <code>while(var := condition)</code>, 
        else they used a plain expression.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>If</td><td>Represents an if statement. The false_statement node may be null if the user did not create an else branch. condition or var_condition will be null depending on form, as with while.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Throw</td><td>Throw may have no expression, in which case it corresponds to rethrow.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Return</td><td>Return may have no expression, in which case it corresponds to a void return.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>FunctionArgument</td><td>May have no type expression.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Function</td><td>May have no explicit return. Some members like the list of statements of the body are meaningless when some other members, like defaulted or deleted, are set.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Catch</td><td>May not have a type expression. This corresponds to a catch-all. The constructors set the "all" member appropriately.</td></tr>

    <p>The AST Combiner takes several AST modules and presents them as a single unified AST. This allows for unified analysis of several sources (typically, several parsed files). The Combiner may own some but not all elements of 
    the resulting unified AST. The current implementation creates and owns modules, and it keeps a reference to all AST nodes it unifies. The Combiner is mutable and can add or remove a single source at a time for incremental
    re-unification. Simply default-construct a combiner, add the modules you need to present as a unified source, and then use GetGlobalModule to get back the root module of the combined AST.</p>
