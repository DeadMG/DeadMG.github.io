        <h1>Building Wide</h1>

<div class="container">
    <p>Building Wide is a somewhat tricky process, due to the fact that it has a large dependency which takes some care to build correctly.</p>
    <p>Currently, Wide requires premake4, Boost, and LLVM/Clang to build.</p>

    <tr><th>Build Dependency</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Boost</td><td>Wide depends on Boost.Variant, and Boost.ProgramOptions. Boost.ProgramOptions is not header-only so an appropriate Boost.ProgramOptions binary is needed.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LLVM/Clang</td><td>Wide depends on APIs that are not made public by Clang. This means that you have to build LLVM/Clang (a dev package on Linux is not enough). If you are using Itanium ABI (Clang/GCC) then be especially 
    careful to enable RTTI when building them. Wide depends on RTTI and Itanium cannot handle linking together programs compiled with and without RTTI. When building with MSVC on Windows be especially careful to set your settings for 
    stuff like static/dynamic Standard library correctly, as rebuilding to fix any mismatches will be unpleasant.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Premake</td><td>On Linux, a premake4 package is sufficient. On Windows you will need <a href="https://bitbucket.org/DeadMG/wide/downloads/premake4.exe">a build of Premake 4.4</a> which is not officially released yet.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Host toolchain</td><td>Wide depends on some of the earliest-implemented C++11 features, like lambdas and rvalue references. Wide also makes use of C++11 stdlib features. Wide also uses RTTI and exceptions.</td></tr>

    <tr><th>Execution Dependency</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Standard Library</td><td>Wide uses Clang 3.4 and Itanium ABI. This means that on Windows you will need GCC with libstdc++. MinGW >4.6 has known ABI incompatibility. libstdc++ 4.9 has known incompatibility with Clang 3.4.
    Wide is currently tested against libstdc++ 4.8.2 x64 on Linux and MinGW 4.6.3 x86 on Windows. Wide currently invokes g++ to detect include paths automatically on Linux. On Windows, Wide expects to find MinGW in the working 
    directory- else you can pass a command-line flag to locate it. Wide is not tested against any other stdlib or platform.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Wide stdlib</td><td>Wide expects to find its own stdlib packaged relative to either the executable directory or the working directory. The build script will automatically package this for you in the Deployment directory.
