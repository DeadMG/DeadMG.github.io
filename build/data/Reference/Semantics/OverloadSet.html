	<p>Overload sets come in two kinds- member and non-member.</p>
    <p>Non-member overload sets are an aggregate type with no members. Member overload sets are aggregates whose members are one pointer to the bound type. Member overload sets that were bound to lvalues and rvalues are distinct 
	types.</p>
	<p>An overload set may hold an arbitrary number of Wide resolvables, and C++ functions or function templates.</p>
	<p>Overload sets offer the function call operator. When called, they call one of the Wide resolvable or C++ functions that they hold with the argument list. The algorithm for determining which one is known as overload resolution.</p>
	<p>When invoking an overload set directly, if the overload set is a member overload set, then de-reference the held pointer, and cast the result to an rvalue if the overload set was bound to an rvalue, and place this extra
	argument at the front of the argument list.</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Consider the Wide and C++ sets separately. If overload resolution succeeds for exactly one of these sets, the call is made to that callable, else, the program is ill-formed. Overload resolution for C++ sets fails if 
		any type in the arguments is not convertible to a C++ type. Else, the rules for C++ overload resolution are determined by the C++ Standard. For Wide sets,</li>
	    <li>Remove from the set all resolvables that cannot accept the argument list. If there are no resolvables left, then overload resolution fails.</li>
		<li>For all remaining resolvables, determine the parameter list. One resolvable is more specialized than another if, for at least one parameter, that parameter is-a the corresponding parameter, and the reverse is not true
        for any pair of parameters.</li>
		<li>Sort the set of resolvables according to which is more specialized. If the most specialized resolvable is more specialized than the next resolvable in the sorted list, then that resolvable is the result. Else, overload 
		resolution fails.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Overload sets also offer a single named member, named "resolve". The result of accessing this member shall be a value, that is a meta type, that when invoked with arguments that shall all be constructor types, shall produce 
	an overload set whose sole resolvable shall be the result of overload resolution from the set with argument types that correspond to the types passed. No implicit this is added- if a resolvable is a member function then the 
	first argument passed to resolve is the type of this.</p>
	<p>The union of two overload sets is an overload set containing the union of the Wide resolvables and C++ functions of the arguments.</p>
