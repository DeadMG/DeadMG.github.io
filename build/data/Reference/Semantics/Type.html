	<p>The Wide object model is a fairly close match to C++. All objects in Wide are defined as two things- a region of memory, of a given size and alignment, and a type. The type of an object is a piece of metadata that defines 
	what operations are legal to perform on that object. Each type stores a number of properties. Some of these are made directly available on a constructor type for that type. Each object's area of storage must be 
	distinct from every other object, except for objects that store other objects.
    </p>
    <h2>Valid states</h2>
	<p>It is assumed that for a given type, not all possible binary memory states are valid instances of that type. For user defined types, then the implementation can only reason about valid states based on which user-defined 
	functions are required to produce valid states. Only the destructor is permitted to take an object of a valid state and leave it in an invalid state. Only a constructor may take (only as the first argument) an object of an 
	invalid state, and if it returns, this object must be in a valid state. Observing the state of an object with invalid state is undefined behaviour. Calling a constructor whose first argument is an object with valid state is 
	undefined behaviour. This means that every object must be constructed exactly once and destructed exactly once.</p>
	<h2>Properties</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Types must have a size and alignment. These dictate the size and alignment of memory required to store an object of that type.</li>
	<li>Types may have another type as a context. All types have a different type as their context, without cycles, except the global Wide module and global C++ namespaces for each TU, which have no context.</li>
	<li>A type may be empty. An object of an empty type may arbitrarily overlap the memory of other objects, even other objects of the same empty type.</li>	
	<li>A type may be a constant type. Constant types do not represent any run-time state of the program.</li>
	<li>A type has a non-empty constructor overload set. The first argument must be an lvalue reference of that type that refers to the storage the object will occupy. An object's lifetime begins when a constructor returns. 
	Any	access to an object in an invalid state is undefined behaviour.</li>
	<li>A type has a destructor. This function, when called, turns the object from a valid state to an invalid state.</li>
	<li>A type may have named members.</li>
	<li>A type may be "is-a" another. By default, a type is-a itself and it is-a an rvalue reference to itself.</li>
	<li>A type has member overload sets that correspond to operators. By default, these overload sets are empty.</li>
	<li>A type may be reference "is-a" another. By default, a type is only reference is-a itself.</li>
	<li>A type may have ADL performed. By default, the ADL function for operators accesses operator members in the context of the type, and the context's context recursively until it reaches the root. The result is the union of 
	all found overload sets.</li>
	<li>A type may be C++ convertible. By default, it is not.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some terms and concepts in the reference refer to specific states of these properties.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>A type t is copy-constructible if overload resolution of the constructor overload set succeeds, with the argument list as t.lvalue and t.lvalue. The found callable is known as the copy constructor.</li>
	<li>A type t is move-constructible if overload resolution of the constructor overload set succeeds, with the argument list as t.lvalue and t.rvalue. The found callable is known as the move constructor.</li>
	<li>A type t is copy-assignable if overload resolution of the constructor overload set succeeds, with the argument list as t.lvalue and t.lvalue. The found callable is known as the copy assignment operator.</li>
	<li>A type t is move-assignable if overload resolution of the constructor overload set succeeds, with the argument list as t.lvalue and t.rvalue. The found callable is known as the copy assignment operator.</li>
	<li>A type is trivially copy-constructible if it is copy-constructible, and the found resolvable simply copies the second argument to the first.</li>
	<li>A type is trivially move-constructible if it is move-constructible, and the found resolvable simply copies the second argument to the first.</li>
	<li>A type is trivially copy-assignable if it is copy-assignable, and the found resolvable simply copies the second argument to the first.</li>
	<li>A type is trivially move-assignable if it is move-assignable, and the found resolvable simply copies the second argument to the first.</li>
	<li>A type is trivially destructible if it is destructible, and the found resolvable performs no work.</li>
	<li>A type is trivially constructible if all possible states of the object's memory are valid instances of that object. The usual rules for validity do not apply to such objects. They are valid as long as the memory in which 
	they live is valid. Calling a constructor or destructor on such an object is well-defined, even if it would usually be undefined.</li>
	<li>A type is dynamic if it has dynamic functions. A type cannot be dynamic and trivially constructible, copy constructible, copy assignable, move constructible, or move assignable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Normally under the as-if rule, invoking one user-defined function instead of another would count as an observable side effect. However, Wide explicitly permits implementations to make some assumptions about the semantics
	entailed in destructors, assignment operators, and constructors. For assignment operators, it is assumed that they do not observe the state of their left-hand-side, except that it must be a valid state. For a copy constructor
	or copy assignment operator, the state of the second argument should not be observably mutated, and the observable state of the first argument should be the same as the observable state of the second. For a move constructor 
	or assignment operator, the state of the second argument should be considered undefined but valid. For a destructor, the state of the object should not be considered observable, except that it must be valid.</p>
