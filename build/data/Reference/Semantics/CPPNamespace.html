	<p>Each C++ namespace in a given translation unit has a unique corresponding Wide type. This type is a meta type. The result of creating a C++ translation unit is a value of the type corresponding to the global namespace
	of that translation unit.</p>
	<p>In addition to the regular rules for Meta types, C++ namespaces also support member accesses. Accessing a member of a C++ namespace produces a result depending on what is found by qualified lookup of that name in that
	namespace.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>If the member names a nested namespace, then the result is a value of the type corresponding to that namespace, else</li>
		<li>If the member names one or more function and function template declarations or definitions, then the result is a non-member overload set containing those declarations, else</li>
		<li>If the member names a class template declaration or definition, then the result is a value of the corresponding C++ template type, else</li>
		<li>If the member names a class or struct, then the result is a value of the corresponding constructor type of the C++ type named, else</li>
		<li>If the member names a variable, then the result is a collapsed lvalue reference to the variable, else</li>
		<li>The program is ill-formed.</li>

	<p>The <i>context</i> of a C++ namespace is its parent namespace. If it is the global namespace of a TU, then it has no context.</p>
