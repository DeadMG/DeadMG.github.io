    	<p>An aggregate type is a classification of types in the Wide type system. Aggregate types have properties based on the properties of their members. Most aggregate types add or change some behaviours.</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Aggregate types have a public [trivial] copy constructor if there is no member without a visible [trivial] copy constructor.</li>
	        <li>Aggregate types have a public [trivial] move constructor if there is no member without a visible [trivial] move constructor.</li>
	        <li>Aggregate types have a public [trivial] copy assignment operator if there is no member without a visible [trivial] copy assignment operator.</li>	
	        <li>Aggregate types have a public [trivial] move assignment operator if there is no member without a visible [trivial] move assignment operator.</li>
	        <li>Aggregate types have a public [trivial] default constructor if there is no member without a visible [trivial] default constructor.</li>
	        <li>Aggregate types are constant if they have no non-constant members.</li>
	        <li>Aggregate types are empty if they have no non-empty members.</li>
	        <li>The destructor of an aggregate type destroys all members in reverse order. It is non-trivial if any member's destructor is non-trivial.</li>
	    </ul>
    	<p>User defined types, arrays, tuples, lambdas, and overload sets are all aggregate types.</p>
