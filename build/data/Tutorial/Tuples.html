        <p>Wide has language-level support for tuples. Tuple objects are specified as <code>{ expressions }</code>. You can unpack tuples using <code>x, y := tuple;</code>. Tuples can contain any Wide object, and they have available
        operations that their members support, such as copying.</p>
        <p>Wide supports tuple-initialization. This is for Wide and C++ user-defined types that do not define any of the five special members- copy/move constructor/assignment operator, and destructor. This is essentially a special 
        constructor which accepts a tuple, where each member is constructed from one object in the tuple. Wide can also perform implicit conversions if the object types are implicitly convertible to the members.</p>
