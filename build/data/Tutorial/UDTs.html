        <p>A Wide user-defined type is introduced with the <code>type</code> keyword. Member variables are defined by initializing them to a type. They can also be initialized to values for a non-static data member initializer. In 
        this case Wide infers the type per the same rules for function locals.</p>
        <p>Wide types can define member functions. Like C++ types bound member functions are overload sets, which are objects in their own right. Wide member functions can take an explicit <code>this</code> argument. This provides
        for lvalue/rvalue overloading for member functions.</p>
        <p>Wide types can define constructors and destructors as in C++, but Wide uses the <code>type</code> keyword again, rather than the type name. Wide constructor initializer lists use <code>expression := expression</code> to 
        initialize members. Wide will not implicitly define a copy or move constructor or assignment operator, or destructor, if any of the five are defined as non-defaulted. Also note that unlike C++, if you do not define a move 
        constructor, Wide will not pick the copy constructor as a move constructor. Wide also supports delegating constructors. Inheriting constructors may be implemented later.</p>
        <p>Wide types can have base classes and they can inherit from C++ types. They can also define dynamic member functions that override virtual functions from C++. Wide defines the constructor initializer as an expression as 
        Wide type references are expressions, such as <code>cplusplus.base</code>. Currently, there is no equivalent to virtual inheritance, and many operations on types that include virtual inheritance will crash the compiler.</p>
        <p>Like in C++, you can default all of the five special member functions- copy constructor, move constructor, move assignment operator, copy assignment operator, and destructor. Wide follows the Rule of Zero- if you define 
        any of these functions as non-defaulted, Wide does not generate any that were not explicitly defaulted (except destructor). This is referred to as a <code>complex</code> type.</p>
