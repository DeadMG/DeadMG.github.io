        <p>Virtually all things you can express in Wide are considered objects. This includes the core concept of overload sets. When you use a name that resolves to one or more Wide or C++ functions, this produces an overload set
        value which we can pass around like any other, and even return from themselves or pass as arguments to themselves, if they are duck-typed. Wide overload sets can carry both Wide and C++ functions at the same time. A typical
        scenario in which this occurs is ADL for binary operators, or looking up member functions for derived types.</p>
        <p>Currently, values of operator overload sets are produced but are not user-exposed due to limitations of the current implementation, as neither "operator+" nor "t.operator+" is legal syntax. These are set to be lifted 
        soon.</p>
        <p>Overload sets can also be bound. The syntax "t.f()" has no special interperation in Wide- the subexpression "t.f" must produce an object that can be called with no arguments. This directly means that member function 
        references of both Wide types and C++ types are valid objects. Binding occurs strictly by reference, never by value. Bound overload sets remember whether they were bound to an lvalue or an rvalue.</p>
