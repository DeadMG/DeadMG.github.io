        <p>The Main function defines the code invoked at the beginning of every Wide program. Since Wide does not yet have its own Standard library for I/O, we will simply invoke C++'s. The cplusplus identifier provided by the web
        interface is a C++ namespace- the global namespace of the C++ code on the right. When we access a member of a namspace, this refers to the corresponding member of that namespace in that translation unit. Once we have looked
        up ::std::cout,	then we can use the << operator, just as in C++. Interoperating with C++ is both a core motivation for Wide's existence and a key skill in the early stages. We'll take a look at Wide's other C++ 
        interoperation features after a brief tour of the very basics of Wide.</p>
