        <p>Local variables in Wide are introduced with <code>:=</code>. They are always initialized by calling the constructor. The type is deduced from the initializing expression. Wide always deduces a value, like 
        <code>auto</code> in C++, unless you explicitly construct an object of a type, in which case the local will always have that type, even if it's a reference. Local variables in Wide are subject to the same rules of 
        destruction as those in C++. The lifetime of temporaries, however, was expanded to the whole scope.</p>
