        <p>A core tenet of Wide's interoperation strategy is that you should be able to migrate existing C++ codebases to Wide one piece at a time. This implies implementing C++ functions from Wide. To do this we introduce the 
        <code>export</code> attribute. Currently only certain special attributes are supported, not generic user-defined attributes. The export attribute defines that a Wide function should be exported as implementing a given C++ 
        function. The detail of mangled names is handled automatically by the implementation and not exposed to the user.</p>
        <p>For functions which stand alone, a simple reference is enough. For functions which are members of an overload set, we introduce the <code>resolve</code> member. The result of calling <code>resolve</code> with a list of 
        types is an overload set carrying the single C++ function that was result of performing overload resolution on that set. Exported member functions gain all the rights, like implicit member lookup and private member 
        access, of ordinary member functions. You can access members statically using <code>t.members</code>. This presents static and non-static members uniformly, where non-static members also take a <code>this</code>. It is also 
        the means you can use to access other static context like types or constants.</p>
        <p>Wide does not inherently ban having two functions in a set that would always be ambiguous. This merely makes them uncallable, which is perfectly acceptable if their main purpose is to be exported. Similarly to support
        exporting constructors and destructors, both can be declared at module scope instead of just at member scope. To refer to a constructor or destructor, you can simply use <code>t.constructors</code> or <code>t.destructor</code>. 
        When defining a destructor, Wide automatically adds <code>this</code> for you.</p>
        <p>Wide can perform implicit conversions when creating thunks, for argument types and return types. This was upgraded from covariance in C++ because of the problem of smart pointers not being directly covariant but needing 
        to support the same derived-to-base conversions in the same contexts.</p>
