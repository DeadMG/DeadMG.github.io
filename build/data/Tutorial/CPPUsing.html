        <p>The <code>cpp</code> object in the global module is the driver behind Wide's C++ interoperation facilities. The methods on this object are what enable you to interact with C++ translation units. Simply call the object 
        with the path of the file you want to load, and it returns an object representing the global namespace of that TU. The object caches all file requests. It also aggregates them into a single translation unit. This saves a 
        lot of time re-parsing the same headers, especially stdlib headers. The compilation service currently uses libstdc++ 4.9 and also provides Boost 1.55. Wide's facilities are powered by Clang 3.4, which has known 
        interoperation issues with libstdc++ 4.9. To implement the web service, the C++ source is uploaded to the service host, and then this is automatically included for you.</p>
        <p>When dealing with C++ types from Wide, macros are non-entities- if you look up an identifier in a namespace, macros are not substituted in. However, you can explicitly request the value of a macro by using <code>
        cpp.macro</code>. Wide can interpret a subset of C++ expressions and evaluate them. Wide currently cannot evaluate function-like macros and macros are evaluated in the context of their source TU. Nor can Wide cope with 
        macros that do not result in expressions. Constant expressions retain their constant semantics, except that Wide does not currently support treating C++11 constexpr expressions as constants.</p>
        <p>The <code>using</code> definition in Wide can give a name to any expression of a constant type. This includes types, namespaces, non-bound overload sets, and more. It does not include expressions of constant value that 
        are of non-constant type, such as integers. Currently, each string has a distinct constant type, rather than being of distinct value. This is due to change. One of the main uses is to name C++ translation units. The Wide 
        library automatically provides, under the global name <code>std</code>, the std namespace of a TU including most C++ Standard library headers. This makes for a fairly natural use of common C++ Standard library functionality.</p>     
        <p>For headers or TUs that don't play well with others, you can use <code>cpp.header</code>. This method returns a callable which, when invoked with a filepath, creates a distinct translation unit per filepath. Note that 
        C++ types which are defined in different TUs are considered different types by Wide, even if they are really the same type. Types that are primitives like references and integer types, or types that were originally 
        converted from a Wide type, do not have this problem. Wide compiles and links all TUs requested by the program- if you request a translation unit with non-inline definitions, this is quite acceptable as long as you don't 
        compile the same TU again externally and link it with a linker.</p>
        <p>Finally, the cpp object also allows the use of C++ literals through <code>cpp.literal</code>. Call this object with a literal string to receive that string interpreted as a C++ translation unit. It's mostly useful for 
        demonstration or debugging/testing.</p>
